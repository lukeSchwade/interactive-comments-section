## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For CSS precompiler


### What I learned
I learned how to use SASS mixins for media breakpoints, which was tremendously useful
I learned about `<slot>` and `<template>` for creating comment templates which were useful for creating modular elements, presumably this is handled by JS frameworks though.
I also learned how incredibly useful grid layouts are for mobile-first.



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I want to continue to build on this and maybe eventually build a web-facing app that lets people add comments


### Useful resources

- [Mixins media breakpoints](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54594580/sass-media-query-mixin-combination) - Very helpful implementation of how to do media breakpoints with mixin
- [Managing heirarchal data](https://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/) - A good article for thinking about managing heirarchal data (such as when displaying recursive comments)
